This example uses a multi-select image field, called "cover_images" to create an image slider using Bootstrap's Carousel element. The template uses an `[each]` block to loop through each cover_images. The entire markup is wrapped in an '[if]` block to prevent any html from being outputted if there are no images in the field.
